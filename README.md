Faurecia BioFit Demo iOS
========================

Sample iOS iPhone application demonstrating use of the Faurecia BioFit SDK

### Running the application 
1. Open FaureciaBioFitDemo.xcodeProj
2. Run FaureciaBioFitDemo.  To work, it must deploy to a device, not a simulator.  This is because the simulator does not have Bluetooth.


###Using the application
1. On the first screen, press the "start" button.  The list will populate with all the Bluetooth peripherals in range.
2. Select the BioFit Peripheral you would like to connect to.  Note: You need to "sit down" in the simulator to start advertising.
3. The app will connect, and receive data from the BioFit Peripheral. Mission Accomplished
